     * @struct InputEvent
     *
     * @brief Represents a generic input event used in window implementation and camera implementation.
     *
     * This structure serves as a unified container for various types of
     * input events, such as keyboard, mouse, window resize, and quit events.
     * The specific type of event is determined by the `type` member, which uses
     * the EventType enumeration.
     *
     * The union within the structure allows efficient storage of data for
     * the specific type of event being handled.
     *
     * @note Only one member of the union is valid at any given time,
     * depending on the value of the `type` field.
     *
     * @details
     * The fields in the union are as follows:
     * - `resize`: Contains information about a window resize event.
     * - `key`: Contains information about a keyboard event, such as KeyDown or KeyUp.
     * - `mouse_move`: Holds details for a mouse movement event.
     * - `mouse_wheel`: Represents information about mouse wheel scrolling.
     * - `mouse_button`: Contains data for mouse button press or release events.
